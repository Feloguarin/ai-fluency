# AI Fluency Analysis — one command, full run

You produce a reliable AI-fluency **skill map** for this developer from their real
Claude Code transcripts. One run, three parts:

1. **Measure (deterministic).** `insight.py` parses transcripts, de-contaminates and
   scrubs them, and computes the numbers — rate-based, confidence-hedged, archive-backed
   so it sees **more than Claude Code's 30-day window**.
2. **Explore (Sonnet 4.6).** Parallel explorers read the evidence, one per AI-fluency competency.
3. **Analyze (Opus 4.8).** A senior assessor writes the skill map, **grounded in the bundled
   AI Fluency framework**, then verifies it is evidence-grounded.

The skill is self-contained: the engine and the framework are bundled next to this file at
`~/.claude/skills/ai-fluency/`, and all working files land in `~/.claude/insight/`.

## Step 1 — Measure + emit evidence

These working files live at fixed, reused paths, so first delete any leftovers from a
previous run (or a different person on a shared machine) — a stale `analysis.json` must
never survive into this run and get merged as if it were this user's:

```bash
rm -f ~/.claude/insight/evidence.json ~/.claude/insight/analysis.json
```

Then measure (use `--quiet` so the score is NOT surfaced yet — this is one run that should
end in a single finished report, not a score now and a report later):

```bash
python3 ~/.claude/skills/ai-fluency/insight.py --evidence ~/.claude/insight/evidence.json --no-open --quiet -o ~/.claude/insight/ai_fluency_report.html $ARGUMENTS
```

This computes the de-contaminated evidence bundle and writes a fallback deterministic
report. **Do not report the score, archetype, or any result to the user yet** — keep going
to Steps 2–3 and only present the final, AI-personalized report. If it reports no
transcripts, tell the user to pass their transcript directory as `$ARGUMENTS` (default
`~/.claude/projects`). The evidence bundle carries a `meta.run_fingerprint` that binds any
analysis built from it back to this exact run.

## Step 2 — Run the two-model analysis workflow

Print the absolute paths the workflow needs (it reads them with its own Read tool):

```bash
python3 -c "import os; print(os.path.expanduser('~/.claude/insight/evidence.json')); print(os.path.expanduser('~/.claude/skills/ai-fluency/reference/ai-fluency-framework.md'))"
```

Then call the **Workflow** tool with:
- `name`: `ai-fluency`
- `args`: `{ "evidence": "<first line above>", "framework": "<second line above>" }`

The workflow returns the analysis as a JSON object (overall_read, skill_map of the four
competencies, top_growth, strengths). **Sonnet 4.6** explores, **Opus 4.8** analyzes +
verifies — model selection is baked into the workflow.

## Step 3 — Render the final report

Only do this if Step 2 actually returned an analysis. Write the workflow's returned JSON to
`~/.claude/insight/analysis.json` (absolute path; the directory exists from Step 1), then
merge it — passing the evidence bundle it was built from so the engine can confirm the
analysis belongs to this exact run:

```bash
python3 ~/.claude/skills/ai-fluency/insight.py --analysis ~/.claude/insight/analysis.json --analysis-evidence ~/.claude/insight/evidence.json -o ~/.claude/insight/ai_fluency_report.html $ARGUMENTS
```

This Step-3 run is the FIRST time the score is printed (Step 1 was `--quiet`), so the user
sees one finished, AI-personalized report — not a score up front and a report later. The
engine fingerprints this run's data and compares it to the evidence bundle's
`run_fingerprint`; if they don't match (a stale or foreign analysis), it prints a note and
renders the deterministic report instead — so one run's verdict can never leak into another.
On success the report carries Opus's tailored, framework-grounded skill map AND your
highest-leverage growth moves (each rewriting one of your real prompts) on top of the
deterministic numbers. Point the user to `~/.claude/insight/ai_fluency_report.html`.

## Step 4 — Narrate (don't re-derive)

Only now, after the final report exists, give a short, encouraging read in chat: the
**overall score + band + archetype** in one sentence, the **single highest-leverage growth
move** grounded in one of their real prompts, and their **strongest competency** as the
foundation. Keep it to a paragraph or two; the report has the depth.

## Fallbacks

- **No Workflow capability available?** The deterministic report from Step 1 is complete on
  its own — skip steps 2–3. Since Step 1 ran `--quiet`, read the numbers from
  `~/.claude/insight/evidence.json` (or re-run Step 1 without `--quiet`) to narrate, then
  open the report. It will say plainly that the AI skill-map stage didn't run.
- **Explicit path given?** Pass it as `$ARGUMENTS` in steps 1 and 3 (archiving is skipped
  for explicit paths by design).

## Notes

- Original transcripts are never modified. They're copied into an archive
  (`~/.claude/insight-archive`) so history outlives Claude Code's 30-day cleanup.
- Scores measure observable behavior, not intent; thin signals are flagged "low data" and
  hedged — don't over-claim on those.
